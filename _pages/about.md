Hi there! I graduated from college with a computer science degree and I'm now a second year PhD at UIUC working under [Ramnatthan Alagappan](https://ramalagappan.github.io) and [Aishwarya Ganesan](https://aishwaryaganesan.github.io) to build interesting and highly perfomant distributed and storage systems.

I like to tinker with other stuff ~ clang/llvm, reverse-engineering, computer graphics, game development, virtual/augmented reality, (having worked a bit in each one) though I'm certainly not an expert in those fields.

You can find research I've published on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GTX7CDMAAAAJ&hl=en) or take a look at my [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) and [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) to see some interesting things that I've worked on! :)
