Hi there! I graduated from college with a computer science degree and I'm now a fourth year PhD at UIUC working under [Ramnatthan Alagappan](https://ramalagappan.github.io) and [Aishwarya Ganesan](https://aishwaryaganesan.github.io) to build interesting and highly perfomant distributed storage systems.

You can find [research]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/) I've published on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q3IeO4wAAAAJ) or take a look at my [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) and [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) to see some interesting things that I've worked on! :)
