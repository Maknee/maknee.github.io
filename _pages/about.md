Hi there! I graduated from college with a computer science degree. 

My current research deals with a combination of compartmentalization, tracing, and code transformation.

I like to tinker with other low-level systems like-stuff such as clang/llvm, reverse-engineering and computer graphics.

However, my interests expand slightly to other fields such as machine learning, OS development, game development, virtual/augmented reality (having worked a bit in each one) though I'm certainly not an expert in those fields.

I plan to create projects that interleaves different fields to explore ideas people think would not be possible otherwise (pretty broad/cheesy phrasing..., but eh).

You can find research I've published on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GTX7CDMAAAAJ&hl=en) or take a look at my [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) and [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) to see some interesting things that I've worked on! :)
