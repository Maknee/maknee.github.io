This was a final class android project that has the goal to make others wake up.

Why was this app created?

College CIS kids. A lot of kiddos like myself don't wake up on time, so this app was born.

Here is a couple of shots/explanation of the app:

Different pages

- Basic main page to sign in
- Friends page to interact with friends and it displays all their alarms
- Ranking page to see who was at the top of their game
- Feeds page to see who had interacted with who (sort of like facebook)

You could send alarms to buddies to wake them up at specific times

Achievment page

You could challenge someone to wake up at a specific time

To solve the challenge, the other person had to solve a problem.

You get these as notifications, so you don't even need the app to be open
