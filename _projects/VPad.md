VPad was a class project where my group built a custom controller to play a small driving Unity game. My partner did most of the controller while I handled writing the game.

Please note that this came from a time when Unity was still in beta and Oculus was still the most well known VR toolset.

This was actually my first time working with VR (albeit, with a pretty limited toolset).

The setup was pretty hacky and it looked like this.

Controller <-> Controller's bluetooth <-> Computer's bluetooth <-> Arduino <-> Unity
