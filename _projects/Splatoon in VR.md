If you've never heard of Splatoon before, it's a really cool game where the objective is to shoot other players and cover as much of the map as possible with your paint color.

Here is a link to a gameplay video:

This was a class project that uses Unreal Engine 4 to create splatoon, but in VR. 

It was actually quite difficult to get the pieces to work together. This was my first big project in Unreal. There were multiple headaches such as multiplayer and trying to get the bow to shoot correctly, but I did learn a lot.

Here is a demo of the second(?) stage of project (I couldn't find the final version)
