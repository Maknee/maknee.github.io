Scene++ is a framework that enhances the immersion of augmented reality technology.
Currently, augmented reality does not support much interaction with the real world.
Scene++ fixes this by letting the user be able to interact with objects from the real world.
Scene++ runs with Unity with HTC Vive and uses a remote yolo detection program to detect real world objects.

Here is the presentation of the project
