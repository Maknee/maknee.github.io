This was my first experience with [three js](https://threejs.org/), a 3D javascript library and [WebVR](https://webvr.info/), a tool that allows the VR experience in the browser. 

The end result is pretty cool. 

[Watch it here, preferably in a browser that supports webvr](https://pennvr.github.io/three-js-Maknee/)

The project uses three js to generate all the particle effects and uses a custom version of perlin noise to generate the randomness of the particles.
