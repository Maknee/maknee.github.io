OOC is an acroynm for "Object oriented C".

This is a project of mine that provides a library to create and use (possibly templated) data structures in an object oriented way that does not exist in the current C standard library.

Data structures currently implemented are:
- String
- Templated Vector
- Templated Set
- Templated Map

Here is the [github link](https://github.com/Maknee/OOC)
